# Native UI and extensions

UI mode (--ui/Tab) is independent of graphics. Both modes use the installed MyGUI layouts,
skins and fonts for the in-game HUD, windows and Escape menu. Meitou customises the title,
scene transitions and settings; Faithful retains their original presentation where implemented.
Vulkan paints both, choice persisted. `Meitou.Ui` has no window/GPU/simulation dependency.
Host supplies snapshot text/availability and actions that enqueue commands. Extensions receive
read-only binding copies, never mutable world. [MyGUI](formats/mygui.md), [parity](faithful-ui-parity.md).

## Settings

`SettingsMenu` shares category/row geometry and input between both modes: Display, Graphics
(World/Lighting/Water/Effects), Interface, Controls and Advanced. Faithful uses MyGUI skins;
Meitou uses the [UI kit](meitou-ui.md)'s rounded rust plates and paper Save action. Tab or Options
opens it; Esc/the original Kenshi X/Save saves preferences and returns. Changes apply live, with the active
upscaler shown separately from the requested one. Terrain texture quality needs a restart.
Every Graphics sub-page starts with two rows (`SettingsMenu.Presets.cs`):
- **Quality preset** Low / Medium / High / Ultra sets the distance, foliage, grass, reflection, shadow, particle density,
  filtering and texture sliders; High is the start default (texture quality: full size). Distances that follow a
  switch's side (object distance, terrain error: Draw distances; shadow distance: Shadows) are multiples of that side's
  mark, so High reads High in either look. Low also sets the costliest Meitou switches Faithful (AO, indirect light,
  light shafts, clouds, cloud shadows, water, shadows) and quarter-size particles, as `--low-end`; no preset turns a
  costly Meitou effect on, and anti-aliasing and render scale are left alone. The shown preset is derived (sliders and the fifth
  cascade only; Custom otherwise), not saved.
- **All graphics features** sets every Faithful / Meitou graphics switch to one side (gameplay switches and sliders
  untouched); mixed switches show neither side. A switch that does not take (indirect light without ray queries) is ignored.
  Advanced (**All gameplay changes**) and Fixes (**All fixes**) start with the same switch over their own page's
  switches and sliders with both marks (attackers per target); luckyren Mode is left out.
The modal pauses simulation and captures world input; wheel/PageUp/PageDown scroll, Tab/arrows
focus/adjust, Enter activates. Binding capture rejects conflicting/reserved controls; Esc cancels,
Delete unbinds. Defaults and cache deletion ask first. The viewer retains its debug panel.
Settings use 42px rows with a concise description for every setting, 14px labels,
13px values/buttons and 11px hints, with a 17px label-to-description offset;
paper section headers break up the dark plate. `FontPixels` specifies em pixels,
with 2×2 oversampling, kerning and fractional glyph positioning for small text and motion.
Wheel/PageUp/PageDown scrolling eases toward a clamped target independently of frame rate;
clicking stops the glide. Opening/closing takes 140/100ms, page changes 120ms, hover
brightening eases in/out over 160ms and dropdowns fade over 100ms. Hover keeps the raised
button artwork; the sunken surface indicates a press or selection.
Motion changes opacity/position, keeping type size fixed and input aligned.
Window art is a continuous surface baked at 2x the logical size;
only buttons use nine-slice scaling. The dialog is 1120×720 logical pixels; selection uses
pressed surfaces without yellow focus rings/underlines. Weather/time previews are omitted.
Graphics includes the Meitou switches under their related tabs; Advanced contains cache actions.
Pages omit descriptive blurbs; field hints explain the setting's effect and useful constraints.
The sidebar shows the build's nearest Git tag and short commit, embedded during compilation
(`BuildGitTag`/`BuildGitCommit` can override them for source archives).
Click a slider's number to type a value (selected initially); Enter/Tab or clicking outside
applies it, Esc cancels. Decimals (dot/comma), scientific notation, numpad, Ctrl+A and cursor/
selection editing are supported. Invalid/non-finite input leaves the setting unchanged;
valid input is clamped to the slider range and uses its existing rounding rules.

## Extension API

Provisional ApiVersion1: IUiExtension registered explicitly with UiHost.Register, returning
IDisposable. No automatic mod-DLL scanning/loading; incompatible versions/duplicate module IDs
or keys rejected. Keys namespace extension-id:local-name. Failed registration rolls back;
disposal removes factories/styles/overrides/actions/contributions; re-register supported.

RegisterControl builds UiNodes; RegisterStyle supplies state colours/alignment/skin/font/scale/
TextPadding UiInsets; OverrideStyle scoped replacement. RegisterAction receives read-only frame
context/string argument; disabled controls never call it. Contribute supplies ordered slot tree
with optional UI-mode restriction. OverrideControl can extend context.CreateBaseControl(id).
Source/test interfaces are authoritative for signatures; samples in Ui extension tests.

Builtin `meitou` actions drive the original controls in both modes. UiSlots:
hud.toolbar,hud.selection,hud.squad,hud.overlay; first3 map original regions in both modes,
overlay viewport. Equal-order later contribution draws above earlier; shared slot does not automatically
insert into builtin layout. Override factory or choose explicit child placement.

## Layout, input and lifetime

Panels/labels/buttons/compound children: pixel/percentage/offset/right-bottom placement,
absolute/row/column flow, padding/gaps. Parent disabled propagates; clip drawing/hits to parent/
slot. Labels pass input through; panels block world in region. F7 suppresses all UI mouse regions.
Registration/build/action on UI thread; fresh tree each UiFrameContext, no blocking callbacks.
Painter only receives UiControls, never calls module code. Contribution/action exceptions raise
UiHost.Diagnostic; failed contribution omitted atomically, others continue. Modules own resources
outside registration. HUD uses actual snapshot aggregates, shared portrait rendering and original
screen input in both modes, including I/C/M/T/Y shortcuts, map pan/zoom/orders and modal pause.
Inventory/stat interactions and current gaps are tracked in parity ledger.
The painter collects vertices into one upload/rendering and merges adjacent batches with matching
texture, sampling mode and scissor, retaining painter order. A scissor becomes the full viewport only
when all batch vertices lie inside it. Full GPU barriers/shared state occur at pass boundaries.
Font paths are cached; text geometry is keyed by caption/position/scale/colour and capped
per font at 512 entries/1 MiB, and dropped when the font's glyph atlas grows or restarts (its
generation). Fonts are FreeType glyph caches ([fonts](formats/mygui.md)); a text batch records
its atlas texture per run, so an atlas replaced mid-batch still draws correctly. Shape vertices are written in blocks. Opaque union area is reused
until its rectangle sequence changes. Standalone debug-overlay flushes still own their pass.
Inventory drags draw the cell's icon/count at its footprint size and original grab point,
above windows without intercepting drops; the source hides until release/cancellation.
Escape/right click cancels; changing the source snapshot or closing its window cancels too.
